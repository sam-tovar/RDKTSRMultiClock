# RDKTSRMultiClock
This github work features clocks from RDK 3000-Tristar that is developed to view on mobiles and tablets that lack
support of Adobe Flash thus use HTML5 instead. An app of it is planned, and a simplified/elegant version is also planned
with only 2 or 3 hands

Other time-related stuff may be added here.
